# Pi-hole for Entware

Run [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) directly on your [Entware](https://github.com/Entware/Entware) supported device.  

> [!WARNING]
> **Releases here are unofficial and not supported by the Pi-hole developers.**

## Requirements

Only **aarch64-3.10, armv7-3.2 and x64-3.2** <ins>Entware architectures</ins> are currently supported.  
You will need at least **50-100 MB** of free memory on the device to be able to update the gravity database without running out of memory, memory requirements increase as you add more lists.  
Swap file is **recommended**.  

## Installation

# replace [architecture] with one of the supported architectures
```

- Start `pihole-FTL` daemon: `/opt/etc/init.d/S65pihole-FTL start`

> [!IMPORTANT]

Because how different each device can be I won't be able to help with every issue that can be device-specific but feel free to report them anyway.
